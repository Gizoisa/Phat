Manual test for SDDevice:
	- Format an SDHC card with a FAT32 format
	- Copy the contents of testfolder to the SD card
	- Plug-in the SD card to the arduino
	- Run the program
	- You should see a root directory listing consisting of these items (I've purposefully excluded timestamps as these aren't testable):
		"/test folder" - Folder - 0KB 
		"/TEST   .TXT" - File - 0KB
	- You can navigate by entering the number shown to the left of the entry followed by pressing the enter key
	- Which ever file you open or folder you open should list either, the contents if it's a file, or the listing if it's a directory
	- You can press the '/' key to return to the root of the SD card

Note:
	- The order the files will appear in is not guaranteed as it will depend on the order your OS copied them to the card.
	- You can delete a file, and while it will still be present on the sd card (you can check by using a HEX editor), it will no longer be shown
	  As it will have the 0x5E flag set to indicate a deleted file
