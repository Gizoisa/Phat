/// \brief Interface to an SD Card.
/// \details
/// This class serves as an inteface to an SD card.
/// It should work for all High Capacity SD cards (SDHC / SDXC) and micro SD cards that are formatted using FAT32.
/// Due to limitations to software SPI, the transfer rate is about 100kHz on the SPI bus, this could be improved by using a Hardware SPI implementation instead of a software implementation.
/// As long as the hardware implementation inherits from hwlib::spi_bus_bit_banged_sclk_mosi_miso, they should be interchangeable.
