/*! \mainpage Phat
 *  
 *  \section Introduction
 *  Phat is a small FAT32 reading library. It currently only supports reading from FAT32 formatted SD cards
 *  
 *  \section Hardware
 *  Phat runs on an Arduino Due, but should work on other devices as long as the pins used inherit from hwlib::pin_out and hwlib::pin_in and are passed by reference to SDDevice.cpp 
 *  Warning: this has not been tested.
 *  
 *  
 *  \section Limitations
 *  The library currently only supports the simulation of the linux `ls`, `cd` and `cat` commands.
 *  It is also only possible to read directory listings and print file contents, due to memory limitations, there is currently no way to get the file as a stream.
 *  There is also a limit to the amount of "directory entries" that can be retrieved, it is currently set to 100. 
 *  
 *  \section Usage
 *  Add the source code directory (phat) to your project, and include the header files.
 *  Do not forget to add the files to your Makefile!
